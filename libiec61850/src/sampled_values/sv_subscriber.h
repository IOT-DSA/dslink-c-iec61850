/**
 * \defgroup sv_subscriber_api_group IEC 61850 sampled values (SV) subscriber API
 *
 * The sampled values (SV) subscriber API consists of three different objects.
 * The \ref SVReceiver object is responsible for handling all SV Ethernet messages
 * for a specific Ethernet interface. If you want to receive SV messages on multiple
 * Ethernet interfaces you have to use several \ref SVReceiver instances.
 * An \ref SVSubscriber object is associated to a SV data stream that is identified by its appID
 * and destination Ethernet address. The \reg SVSubscriber object is used to install a callback
 * handler \ref SVUpdateListener that is invoked for each ASDU (application service data unit) received for the
 * associated stream. An \ref SVClientASDU is an object that represents a single ASDU. Each ASDU contains
 * some meta information that can be obtained by specific access functions like e.g.
 * \ref SVClientASDU_getSmpCnt to access the "SmpCnt" (sample count) attribute of the ASDU. The actual
 * measurement data contained in the ASDU does not consist of structured ASN.1 data but stored as raw binary
 * data. Without a priori knowledge of the dataset associated with the ASDU data stream it is not
 * possible to interpret the received data correctly. Therefore you have to provide the data access functions
 * with an index value to indicate the data type and the start of the data in the data block of the ASDU.
 * E.g. reading a data set consisting of two FLOAT32 values you can use two subsequent calls of
 * \ref SVClientASDU_getFLOAT32 one with index = 0 and the second one with index = 4.
 *

 *  | -------------- | -------------- |
 *  | BOOLEAN | 1 byte |
 *  | INT8    | 1 byte |
 *  | INT16   | 2 byte |
 *  | INT32   | 4 byte |

 *  | OCTET STRING | 20 byte |
 *  | VISIBLE STRING | 35 byte |
 *  | TimeStamp | 8 byte |
 *  | EntryTime | 6 byte |
 *  | BITSTRING | 4 byte |
 *
 * The SV subscriber API can be used independent of the IEC 61850 client API. In order to access the SVCB via MMS you
 * have to use the IEC 61850 client API. Please see \ref ClientSVControlBlock object in section \ref IEC61850_CLIENT_SV.
